Imagine the future of interaction on the internet.

A future where AI does all the busywork. Whre each visitor gets focused and personalized attention, just like they would from a human representative. Where AI can seamlessly handle bookings, manage email threads, find and answer detailed questions, and even make purchases. Just like today's virtual assistants, but better.

This vision forms the crux of this proposal, an important product that enables AI to revolutionize business interactions on the internet.

## the ai revolution?

We do NOT think AI will be a disruptive technology... we think the technology and people using it will be.

It's these undeveloped "AI-first" tools will change the world on the scale of computers or the internet.

So the question is how? With automation, augmentation, and personalization?

Yes but fundamentally, the answer is "simplicity"... AI will make what was previously complicated, multi-variate, multi-step, just.... simpler. But simplicity is a powerful concept!

So where are we?

In the last year has seen a spectacular acceleration in innovation in AI systems. Technology has been put in place that allows humans to:

- Create incredible creative content,
- Summarize or execute workflows on unstructured data, and
- Scale and automate complicated workflows
- Draw conclusions from a large systems quickly
- Personalize experiences for each user

But aside from ChatGPT, these technologies have not been packaged well to improve business and human systems.

So we suggest that the real challenge in AI isn't models, but in creating AI-first products that enable its potential in real-world applications.

## AI Virtual Agents

Most business interactions happen by way of the internet. Setting appointments, booking hotels, finding and buying products, sending messages, etc... This has led to the "virtual assistant (VA)" industry, which consists of human aids that work on these time consuming actions for busy individuals.

The problem has been that VA's are expensive and not scalable. They often require a lot of training and only work during set hours. This means that most people don't have VA's and those that do, struggle to use them effectively.

So what if we could create a virtual assistant that was always available, and could be trained in minutes? What if it could be trained to do anything a human could do, and do it better?

Well, we think that's possible.
## The AI Agent Platform

So what is the best way to approach the future of AI agents?

We think there is a need for a "platform" built for both internet users and websites. It would allow AI from both to communicate and negotiate effectively based on the "commander's intent" given by their relative stakeholders.

The platform would consist of the following:
- a browser extension that allows users to interact with AI agents on websites
- a website plugin that allows websites to interact with visitors and their agents
- a cloud service that allows AI agents to communicate with each other and negotiate on behalf of their stakeholders (basis for revenue model)
- an "AI marketplace" (app store) that allows users to find and hire AI agents for their websites

This is what we are proposing to create with PageLines over the next 18 months.

### Revenue Opportunities

PageLines will have many opportunities to earn revenue based on how users interact with the platform. Specifics will depend strategy and lifecycle, but over time we could charge for the following:

- for API calls (per 1000) from businesses for messaging agents
- for app store purchases (per month) from businesses for AI agents
- for feature enhancements, and additional "pro" services like analytics
- for "core" apps that are built into the platform (like a calendar app)

### Rare Experience

PageLines itself has existed since 2009. Initially a digital marketing agency, it evolved into a software company in 2010. At that time it became one of the first companies to build a commercial product on top of WordPress. We pioneered the concept of a "professional drag and drop" system for websites and were the leading WP framework for several years.

As part of this process we:
- launched an app store for website components
- managed a community of thousands of users and developers
- built a cloud service allowing users to sync their websites
- continually managed and launched software iterations over several years

And while we have since moved on from that product (drag and drop was added to WP core), it left us with a deep understanding of platform building that is perfect for this project. In effect, this experience will allow us to "see around corners" and avoid many of the natural pitfalls that come with a project on this scale.

Andrew Powers, the founder of PageLines, has also been working with AI for the last 5 years. He has built several AI products and has a deep understanding of the technology and its potential.

## Roadmap

### Today (MVP)

As of the writing of this brief, we've built an MVP that is already onboarding 50+ users a day. This has helped us refine the vision and understand the market.

The goal of this iteration has been learning and putting in place the basic infrastructure for the business.

To date we've built:

- AI Agent creator that allow people to train and customize agents with their preferences
- Website plugin that allows website owners to embed AI agents on their website
- Cloud infrastructure and framework for AI agents to communicate with each other
- Application Infrastructure (auth, billing, email, onboarding, etc...)
- Branding and marketing resources including the initial website
### First year

With the initial business plan and structure in place, it's time to build the founding team. This will include a product manager, designer, and 5 engineers.

Within the first year, we plan to have all long term business platforms in place. This will include:
- Developer API and documentation for AI agents
- AI Agent marketplace (app store)
- AI Agent browser extension that allows users to interact with AI agents on websites
### Second year

In the second year, we plan to focus on growth and expansion. This will include:
- Marketing and sales team to grow user base
- Enterprise Features and Products

## Next Stage and Financing

We plan on being the market leader.

Competing and overcoming competitors in the next 36 months will require significant investments to fund world-class application development and marketing.

Currently, we are raising $2M in seed funding to allow us to begin recruitment and complete the first version of the platform and ecosystem. With this money we will create a team of 10 people, including a product manager, a designer, 5 engineers and a basic marketing team.

After meeting these objectives we also intend to raise further funds to fuel product, growth, and expansion.

Strong financing will ensure the opportunity to build a world class product and team, and allow us to compete with the largest players in the industry.
